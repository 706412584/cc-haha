# reverse-engineering plugin

Multi-platform reverse engineering toolkit for cc-haha. Bundles five MCP
servers, one orchestration agent, six skills, and two slash commands behind a
single plugin install.

## What it gives you

| Surface | Item |
|---|---|
| Agent | `reverse-engineer` — orchestrates triage → static → optional dynamic → report |
| Skills | `triage`, `pe-elf-macho`, `firmware-blob`, `apk-analysis`, `ios-analysis`, `dynamic-debug-overview`, `frida-dynamic`, `gdb-debug`, `lldb-debug`, `crackme-keygen`, `re-report` |
| Commands | `/reverse-engineering:triage <path>`, `/reverse-engineering:report <sample-id>` |
| MCP servers | `ghidra` (pyghidra-mcp), `radare2` (radareorg/radare2-mcp), `gdb` (mcp-gdb), `lldb` (stass/lldb-mcp), `jadx` (zinja-coder/jadx-mcp-server), `apktool` (zinja-coder/apktool-mcp-server), `frida` (FuzzySecurity/kahlo-mcp) |
| Hooks | placeholder (add a fileCreated hook locally if you want SOC-style auto-triage) |

## Dynamic capabilities (what AI can actually drive)

This is the lane that matters most for AI-driven RE. Static analysis has
limited ROI when reading optimised, obfuscated, or stripped code; runtime
observation turns hypotheses into facts. The plugin ships three dynamic
lanes that don't overlap:

| Capability | Frida | GDB | LLDB |
|---|---|---|---|
| Read/write process memory | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Read/write GP registers | ✅ inside hook | ✅ | ✅ |
| Call stack | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Function-level hook | ✅ | ✅ via breakpoint | ✅ via breakpoint |
| Address-level hook (any instruction) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Instruction-level trace | ✅ Stalker (cheap) | ⚠️ stepi loop (slow) | ⚠️ thread step-inst loop (slow) |
| **Real single-step (instruction)** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Real software/hardware breakpoints** | ⚠️ trampoline only | ✅ | ✅ |
| Watchpoint (byte granularity) | ⚠️ page only | ✅ | ✅ |
| Reverse-debug | ❌ | ✅ rr / record full | ⚠️ limited |
| Java method hook | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| ObjC method hook | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cross-arch (MIPS/PPC/68k/SH) | ⚠️ via frida-server | ✅ gdb-multiarch + qemu | ⚠️ no PPC32/68k |
| iOS device | ✅ frida-server jailbroken | ⚠️ via debugserver | ✅ via debugserver |

The agent reads `dynamic-debug-overview` first to pick the right lane.
For "single-step through MIPS router firmware" → GDB. For "what URL does
this Android app POST to" → Frida. For "step into ObjC method on iOS" →
LLDB.

## Architecture coverage

The reverse-engineering decompilers (Ghidra, radare2) are multi-arch by
design. The `pe-elf-macho` and `firmware-blob` skills cover:

- **x86 / x86-64** — Windows PE, Linux ELF, macOS Mach-O (the default case)
- **ARM** — ARMv4-v8, Thumb/Thumb2 interworking, AArch64. Cortex-M
  (Thumb-only) flash images load via `firmware-blob` using the vector-table
  heuristic.
- **MIPS** — MIPS32/64, big and little endian, MIPS16e/microMIPS. Common in
  routers, PSX, older PIC32, embedded Linux.
- **PowerPC** — PPC32/PPC64, plus VLE (e200, NXP MPC57xx automotive). Common
  in Wii/GameCube, Xbox 360, older Macs, network gear.
- **Motorola 68k** — M68000 through 68060, ColdFire. Old Macs, Atari ST,
  Amiga, Sega Genesis. Recognises Mac Toolbox A-line traps when applicable.
- **SuperH** — SH-2 (Sega Saturn) and SH-4 (Dreamcast).
- **RISC-V** — RV32/RV64 with C/M/A/F/D extensions.
- **Smaller ISAs Ghidra/r2 also handle** — AVR (Arduino), MSP430, 6502
  (NES), Z80, TriCore, Hexagon, Xtensa.

The `firmware-blob` skill specifically handles raw blobs (no PE/ELF/Mach-O
header) — router firmware, Cortex-M flash dumps, U-Boot uImages, console
ROMs, ECU dumps — by identifying the ISA + endianness + base address before
loading into Ghidra/r2 with the right processor module.

## Install

From the repo root, add the marketplace by directory:

```pwsh
# inside cc-haha checkout
$env:CC_HAHA_PLUGIN_MARKETPLACE='C:\Users\70641\cc-haha\plugins'
# Then in the desktop UI: Settings → Plugins → Add marketplace → paste the path,
# install "reverse-engineering", enable.
```

Or via the CLI:

```pwsh
./bin/claude-haha plugin marketplace add C:\Users\70641\cc-haha\plugins
./bin/claude-haha plugin install reverse-engineering@cc-haha-builtin
```

Validate the manifest at any time:

```pwsh
./bin/claude-haha plugin validate plugins/reverse-engineering
```

## Quickstart — first real run

Once the plugin is enabled and at least one of the underlying tools is on
your PATH (Ghidra or radare2 covers most native cases), pick a small,
non-malicious open-source binary to drive the workflow. `busybox` is a
good first target — it's a single static ELF, big enough to be
interesting, small enough to finish quickly.

```pwsh
# 1. Get a sample
mkdir samples
curl -L -o samples/busybox 'https://busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.31.0-defconfig-multiarch-musl/busybox-x86_64'

# 2. Triage — identifies file type, packing, picks the next skill
#    (in chat) /reverse-engineering:triage samples/busybox

# 3. Static analysis happens automatically once triage routes to pe-elf-macho.
#    For a non-x86 sample (firmware blob, MIPS router image, Cortex-M flash dump),
#    triage routes to firmware-blob first, which identifies the ISA and base
#    address before handing back to pe-elf-macho.

# 4. Final report
#    (in chat) /reverse-engineering:report <sample-id>
```

Expected products under `${ARTIFACT_DIR}/<sample-id>/`:

```
triage.md            — file type, entropy, routing decision
static-native.md     — imports, key functions decompiled, strings, decoded constants
report.md            — verdict + findings table + IOCs + open questions
```

Confidence is honest: static-only conclusions about runtime behaviour cap
at medium. To upgrade to high you have to run `frida-dynamic` against a
target you've authorised.

## Development workflow (changing skills / agent prompts)

The plugin loader caches each plugin under
`~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/` keyed on the
manifest version. That means a naive "edit SKILL.md, reload" loop **will
not see your changes** until the version is bumped.

Two options:

### Option A — version bump (publishing flow)

```pwsh
# Edit plugin sources, then:
# 1. Bump "version" in plugins/reverse-engineering/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
# 2. Re-materialise:
Invoke-RestMethod -Method POST -Uri http://127.0.0.1:3456/api/plugins/update `
  -ContentType 'application/json' `
  -Body '{"id":"reverse-engineering@cc-haha-builtin","scope":"user"}'
Invoke-RestMethod -Method POST -Uri http://127.0.0.1:3456/api/plugins/reload `
  -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{}'
```

### Option B — dev junction (fast iteration loop)

```pwsh
# Replace the cached version dir with a junction to the in-repo source.
bun run plugins/reverse-engineering/scripts/dev-link.ts

# Now editing any SKILL.md / agent / command takes effect after just:
Invoke-RestMethod -Method POST -Uri http://127.0.0.1:3456/api/plugins/reload `
  -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{}'

# When done, restore the real cache before publishing:
bun run plugins/reverse-engineering/scripts/dev-link.ts --restore
```

`dev-link.ts` is Windows-only (uses `mklink /J`); on macOS/Linux a manual
`ln -s` does the same thing.

## Smoke test

End-to-end check after manifest changes — assumes server (`:3456`) and
vite (`:1420`) are running (start them as documented in
`docs/desktop/10-local-mcp-testing.md`):

```pwsh
bun run plugins/reverse-engineering/scripts/smoke.ts
```

The script registers the marketplace, enables the plugin, runs
`/api/plugins/update` + `/reload`, and asserts that detail returns the
right version, zero errors, and the expected component counts (counted
from the on-disk source, not hardcoded). Exits non-zero on any
mismatch.

## External tool prerequisites

The plugin doesn't ship the underlying tools. You need them on your machine
(installable independently — none are required all at once):

| MCP | What you need | Install |
|-----|---------------|---------|
| `ghidra` | Ghidra (NSA), Java 17+, `uvx` (from `uv`) | https://ghidra-sre.org + set `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` |
| `radare2` | r2 on PATH, Node | https://rada.re |
| `gdb` | GDB on PATH (`gdb-multiarch` for cross-arch), Node | `apt install gdb gdb-multiarch` / `brew install gdb` |
| `lldb` | LLDB on PATH, `uvx` | macOS: built-in via Xcode CLT; Linux: `apt install lldb`; Windows: LLVM installer |
| `jadx` | Java 17+, `uvx` | jadx-mcp-server pulls JADX itself |
| `apktool` | Java 17+, `uvx`, apktool jar | https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/ |
| `frida` | frida-tools, frida-server on the target device, `uvx` | `pip install frida-tools` |

You can disable individual MCP servers (e.g., turn off Frida if you only do
static work) from the desktop **MCP** settings page (Settings → MCP) — the
plugin's job is to bundle the configurations; per-server enable/disable is a
runtime decision, not a manifest one.

## User-config knobs

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` | (env fallback) | Path to Ghidra install. Substituted into the ghidra MCP server's env at launch. |
| `ARTIFACT_DIR` | `artifacts/re-runs` | Where reports and intermediates go. Resolved relative to the agent's current working directory at run time. |

## Scope and rules

- **Read-only on samples.** No skill in this plugin will execute a sample on
  the host. Frida runs only on user-authorised targets (sandboxed device or VM).
- **No public uploads.** No VirusTotal, no malware-bazaar pushes.
- **No commercial license cracking.** The `crackme-keygen` skill is for CTFs
  and self-owned binaries.
- **Confidence is honest.** Static-only conclusions about runtime behaviour cap
  at medium; high requires confirmation by another channel.
